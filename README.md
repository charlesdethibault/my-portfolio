# my-library

creation of library with useful work ( in the making).

**All files should be totally "Run All" reproducible**. Data needed is called directly within the notebooks.

Files starting with "R" are in R, if no languages mentionned, files are in Python.

R files are using Google Colab Jupiter Notebooks and links to Google Colab are at the beginning of each files.
